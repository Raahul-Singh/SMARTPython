S.M.A.R.T Algorithm - Python Implementation
===========================================

1. Introduction
---------------
This repository contains an implementation of the [S.M.A.R.T Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.5898) in Python, containing routines to identify and extract magnetic properties of regions in solar magnetograms. It has been cloned from the [FLARECAST Bitbucket repository](https://dev.flarecast.eu/stash/projects/SAND/repos/smart/browse). Note this code has not been tested or compared to the TCDSolar SMART repository (which contains the original IDL version), being solely based on the code publication. In addition there is an implementation for feature tracking, which is not described in the paper.

2. Requirements
---------------
The flarecast pipeline must be running, providing access to hmi images and a database for writing properties.
